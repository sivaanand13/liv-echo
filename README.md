- Versal Dashbaord: https://vercel.com/livechos-projects/liv-echo

_Access the Render and Versal dashboards by logging in through Google using the livechofficial@gmail.com account._

_The Express API is deployed on Render's free tier, which will spin down deployments that have been inactive for 15mins. As a result, it may take up to 50s, after the deployed React + Vite app is accessed, for the deployed backend server to start up._
